A webserver-based application based on Google Web Toolkit(GWT). Banking system app allows the Banks to collect and analyze more accurate and comprehensive information of their Customers, to meet federal and state reporting requirements, and to inform policy and programmatic decisions.

Other users need the permission to access the System. Only System User can give the permission to login.
It uses Google App Engine environment for storing the data. App Engine Datastore provides a NoSQL schemaless object datastore, with a query engine and atomic transactions. The App Engine Datastore is a schemaless object datastore providing robust, scalable storage for our web application. It is accessed as ’http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin’.
GWT UI binder helps in productivity and maintainability — it's easy to create UI from scratch or copy/paste across templates and it also makes it easier to collaborate with UI designers who are more comfortable with XML,HTML and CSS than Java source code.
